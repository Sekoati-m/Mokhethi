        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <P>Ms theatre and fitness club is a gym which is formed and established by me, a Mosotho gentleman from Leribe Maputsoe. My gym 
            is located in Maseru near Limkokwing University of Creative & Technologyand Lerotholi Politechnique. The gym offers nothing but the
            best services ever with its top-notch Trojan equipment everyone could think a gym should have. I am a young entrepreneur who think 
            mental health and reduced stress are the key components in every student's academic journey, hence my gym is located near the schools
            so that students can access the gym easily without travelling long distance. I was once a student and i know how painful is like to 
            desire for something like being able to pay for gym but the stipend not being able to cover for that as well as other one's needs, so 
            my gym offers access for students into the gym with the lowest prices ever which matches their stipend.</P>
        <p>This gym as already said above, it is willing to accomodate interested students from nearby universities with the lowest prices that 
            match their income bracket, but that does not mean a person who is not a student is not allowed at the gym but the only difference with 
            such people is that they will pay more than the students do for gym because we believe that such people earn more that the students. We 
            are more concerned about the students because we believe that gym could be one of those places whereby one networks with other people, reduces 
            stress, gains stamina and also improves their mental health through the workouts done there. All those things are going to have a positive 
            impact on one's academics and that is going to make Lesotho to have a high literacy rate in which as a result Lesotho will have people who 
            will be able to transform it for the better. For now we are only located near LUCT and FOKOTHI, but in 10 years to come we want to have have 
            braches all across the country where there are institutions of a higher learning such as NUL and Agric College in Leribe. Our aim is to also
            provide unemployed people with the jobs so that they could be able to put something on the table, save, or pay for their childrens school fees.
            In some other countries, bodybuilding makes people rich but in Lesotho that is not happening, so we want to also host some competition of 
            bodybuilders quartely in a year so as to boost the morale of bodybuilders in Lesotho and also making them to make living out of their bodies.</p>
